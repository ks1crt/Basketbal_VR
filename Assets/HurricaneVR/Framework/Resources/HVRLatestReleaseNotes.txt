2.9

Fixed grab indicators showing up even if they were marked disabled on the HVRGrabbable.
Fixed issue where CockingHandle would not lock forward if the controller was too far forward of the grab point.

Added HVRPoseZone: Uses a provided HVRHandPoser to pose the hand when the hand enters the overlap zone.
	Demo KeyPad updated with a pose zone example.
HVRSocket: New 'PoseTag' field which links with HVRSocketable Poses field for saving orientation when socketed.
HVRSocketable: New Poses field with inspector interface to help save orientations for different socket types.
HVRGunBase: Added Hit event which passes the gun, hitpoint, normal, and direction variables.
HVRHandAnimator: Added 'HandOverride' transform field, allows HVRPosableHand component to be on a different component. VRIK IK targets is one example.
Bow: Fixed hand collision being re-enabled to early with the arrow.
Hand Prefabs: Added trigger collider with HVRHandTrigger component for easy hand detection by other components (HVRPoseZone).
Example Shotgun: modified two hand hold strengths to prevent forehand from moving the shotgun backward to easily.

2.8.7-2.8.8

Fixed hands ignoring collision with each other on the tech demo rig.
Fixed knuckles controllers grip hand animation when using OpenXR.
Fixed physics door not checking if second handle exists.
Fixed socketable throwing null error if instantiated and socketed in the same frame.
Fixed Camera Rig ignoring debug setting for up/down arrow if only the new input system was enabled.

Removed RemainsKinematic from HVRGrabbable and snapshotting/restoring of IsKinematic during the grab procedure. Users should use
	grabbed and released events for this from now on for full control of this field without framework interference.
	
Auto Posing in editor mode randomly has issues when colliders are attached to a rigidbody, the hand poser editor will warn users of this now.

2.8.6

Fixed wheel collider line of sight check and dynamic pose
Fixed bug where force pull would not re-enable collision with the hand if dropped before it reached the hand.
Fixed IsBeingForcedGrabbed not being set to false on a successfull force pull to the hand.
Fixed HVRPhysicsDoor joint anchor not being set to zero sometimes
Fixed null coroutine error on HVRGrabbable if object was disabled prior to being released.

HVRPhysicsDoor upgraded to allow two door handles. Example scene swinging door updated with two separate handles. Web Docs updated.
Custom Hand Setup Wizard completed with tutorial in the web docs.
Virtualized HVRUIPointer methods.
Hand Posing now only works in scene view, prefab mode has issues when posing, a warning will display to alert the user.
Added new demo scene showing how to use hand animation parameters - 'scene_hand_squeeze'
Added commentary and tooltips to several helper components that were missing them.

2.8.5

Fixed an issue where socketed objects would scale differently based on it's rotation prior to being socketed due to AABB sizing.
Fixed trigger colliders being deleted on the ClonedHandModel process.
CloneHandModel defaulted to false on included hand prefabs as ParentHandModel is defaulted to false on new grabbable objects.

2.8.4

Fixed an issue with the version update check logic that was refreshing the asset database after compiles.

Distance Grab Updates:
	Force Pull logic re-worked using kinematics that takes into account mass, gravity, and hand velocity.
	Force Pull Settings updated with Max Acceleration Force, Max Speed, Damping speed parameters to control behaviour.
	
Hand Grab "Pull" sequence is improved and should be smoother, especially after a distance grab is executed.

HVRGrabbable : Added 'BreakDistanceSource' [NoDistanceCheck, Hand, Controller] to control the distance check against the object, or to prevent dropping from distance altogether.

2.8.3.1

OpenXR - added package check and update helper if 1.3 and higher version isn't detected.
VRIK Setup - fix IK solve at setup end when avatar spine isn't using normal forward / right vectors.
Adjust force grab default max force (was too strong for hexabody)


2.8.3

Fixed GC alloc in the socket detection
HVRControllerOffset will smoothly move / rotate to the grab points offset value instead of immediately snapping.
Tweaked force grabber to bring the object closer to the hand before the hand takes over.
Updated Hand Setup Wizard instructions to be more clear.

2.8.2

HurricaneVR extra dll's have been collapsed into a single final dll 'HurricaneVR.Framework'

Fix HVRStabber when the tip / base transforms aren't directly a child of the stabber
Fix HVRTeleporter capsule overlap check math that was failing at small capsule sizes.
Fix grabbing when the hand was set to toggle grab mode but the grabbable was set to Active mode.
Improved post teleport hand / held object positioning if the user rotated the player to a new direction.
HVRSocket - scale grabbable defaulted to false
Added basic EmeraldAI (v3) integration scene
HVRSettings - new DisableHaptics toggle 
HVRPhysicsDial - fixed anchor to start at 0,0,0
